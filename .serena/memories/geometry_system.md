# Geometry System Implementation

## Core Classes (backend/core/geometry/)

### Point2D (`point.py`)
- Represents 2D point with x, y coordinates
- Basic point operations and calculations

### Vector2D (`vector.py`) 
- 2D vector mathematics
- Vector operations (addition, subtraction, dot product, etc.)

### Line (`line.py`)
- Line geometry representation
- Line-related calculations and operations

### Circle (`circle.py`)
- Circle geometry with center and radius
- Circle operations and calculations

### Arc (`arc.py`)
- Arc geometry representation
- Arc-specific operations

### BoundingBox (`bbox.py`)
- Axis-aligned bounding box calculations
- Used for spatial queries and optimization

## Test Coverage
- Comprehensive unit tests in `backend/tests/core/geometry/`
- Test files: `test_point.py`, `test_vector.py`
- Tests use pytest framework

## Integration
- All geometry classes exported via `__init__.py`
- Type hints throughout for mypy compatibility
- Designed for CAD-specific operations and precision
